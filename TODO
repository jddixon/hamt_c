    * README.md and ghpDOc/index.md are more recent than the github
        pages (gh-pages); need to be updated

2014-12-09
    * update ~/dev/update_project_gitignore                             * DONE
    * FIX: HAMT_LD_VERSION is empty string, so linking fails            * DONE

2014-12-08
    * FIX: build fails following check model (hamt.la has to            * DONE
        be built from hamt.lo, which libtools rejects)                  * DONE
